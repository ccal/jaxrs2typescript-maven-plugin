= JAX-RS to Typescript Converter Maven Plugin

== Overview

There are a number of Maven plugins that attempt to convert JAX-RS to Typescript. One
valiant effort creates the base types as interfaces and method calls as .d.ts files. Another
uses Swagger and requires you to generate the Swagger definitions via another plugin.

This attempt is based on my current itch - I want to be able to include the artifacts that provide
JAX-RS APIs as provided dependencies in a Typescript Node Restify server. Then I want to just tell
the plugin to scan for whatever APIs it can find and emit those to a Typescript file, each Resource
exposes as a different service class.

There are some "tests" in the project - thats quoted because they aren't asserted. Its pretty painful to do that.
